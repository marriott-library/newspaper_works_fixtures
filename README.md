NewspaperWorksFixtures
===================================================

This project contains very little code, but provides a set of fixture files under 
version control to facilitate testing of ingest workflows for [newspaper_works](https://github.com/marriott-library/newspaper_works),
or for other digitized newspaper content workflows in general.

# Installation

Add NewspaperWorksFixtures to your `Gemfile`, _preferably only as a test or 
development dependency_:

```ruby
group :development, :test do
  gem 'newspaper_works_fixtures'
end
```

Then run `bundle install`.

Once the gem is installed, you will be able to access the paths to the fixtures by
calling methods on the base `NewspaperWorksFixtures` class, as in:

```
2.4.1 :001 > NewspaperWorksFixtures.file_fixtures
 => "/path/to/newspaper_works_fixtures/spec/fixtures/files"
```

# Contents

#### NDNP 'local' batch
```ruby
# /path/to/gem/spec/fixtures/files/ndnp/batch_local
NewspaperWorksFixtures.ndnp_local_batch
```

A small batch of newspaper objects that is intended to mock vendor-provided
digitization deliverables (page-level objects, no article segmentation) 
conforming to Library of Congress [NDNP specs](http://www.loc.gov/ndnp/guidelines/NDNP_201820TechNotes.pdf).
(The data here is from University of Utah.)

This batch includes 1 title, 1 reel, and 1 issue with 2 pages. Each scan has a 
TIFF, JP2, PDF, and ALTO XML file.

2 image scans; 74 MB

#### NDNP ChronAm batch
```ruby
# /path/to/gem/spec/fixtures/files/ndnp/batch_test_ver01
NewspaperWorksFixtures.ndnp_chronam_batch
```

A small batch of newspaper objects that mimics the BagIt-formatted batches of scanned newspapers
found on the Library of Congress Chronicling America [data/batches](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/data/batches/) site.
(The data here is from `batch_curiv_jojoba_ver01`; page-level objects, no 
article segmentation.)

This batch includes multiple titles, reels, target files, issues, and pages. Each scan has a 
JP2, PDF, and ALTO XML file (no TIFF). All of the corresponding BagIt and METS
files are included as well.

11 image scans; 149 MB
