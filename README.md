NewspaperWorksFixtures
===================================================

This project contains very little code, but provides a set of fixture files under
version control to facilitate testing of ingest workflows for [newspaper_works](https://github.com/marriott-library/newspaper_works),
or for other digitized newspaper content workflows in general.

# Installation

Add NewspaperWorksFixtures to your `Gemfile`, _preferably only as a test or
development dependency_:

```ruby
group :development, :test do
  gem 'newspaper_works_fixtures'
end
```

Then run `bundle install`.

Once the gem is installed, you will be able to access the paths to the fixtures by
calling methods on the base `NewspaperWorksFixtures` class, as in:

```
2.4.1 :001 > NewspaperWorksFixtures.file_fixtures
 => "/path/to/newspaper_works_fixtures/spec/fixtures/files"
```
