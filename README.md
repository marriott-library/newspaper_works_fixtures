newspaper_works_fixtures
===================================================

This project contains very little code, but provides a set of fixture files under 
version control to facilitate testing of ingest workflows for [newspaper_works](https://github.com/marriott-library/newspaper_works),
or for other digitized newspaper content workflows in general.

# Contents

#### NDNP sample batch
`NewspaperWorksFixtures.ndnp_sample_batch`

A small batch of newspaper objects that mimics the BagIt-formatted batches of scanned newspapers
found on the Library of Congress Chronicling America [data/batches](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/data/batches/) site.
(The data here is from `batch_curiv_jojoba_ver01`.)

This batch includes multiple titles, reels, target files, issues, and pages. Each scan has a 
JP2, PDF, and ALTO XML file (no TIFF). All of the corresponding BagIt and METS
files are included as well.

11 page scans; 149 MB
